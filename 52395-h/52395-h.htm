<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>Washington's Journal here given to the public,
if we except his version of the "Rules of Civility and
Decent Behaviour in Company and Conversation,"
is the earliest literary effort of this, the most admirable
character in all history. The editor has long
been engaged in collecting accurate copies of all the
obtainable writings of this great man. Wherever it
has been found practicable to examine and critically
compare even his generally accepted writings with
the originals, it has been, or will be done to secure a
copy of exact and verified conformity, in every particular,
with the text as it left the hand of the writer.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that editors have taken
great liberties with Washington's writings, not for
the purpose of falsifying history, or aspersing his
character, but from a variety of reasons, often to suppress
caustic expressions, or to substitute a more
euphonious word to give to his sentences a fine, rhetorical
finish. Such editorial dressing, even where
the motive is well intended, is vicious in principle
and liable to abuse; and, in the case of Washington's
writings, is neither justifiable nor desirable. The
time has come when the people want to know intimately
and without glamour or false coloring, the
father of his country as he actually lived and labored,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and to possess his writings, just as he left them, on
every subject which engaged his attention. It is the
purpose of the editor to prepare a complete collection
of all the writings of George Washington, from his
youth to the close of his eventful life, with that
literal exactness as to text which can only be assured
by the careful efforts of an experienced copyist and
expert proof reader having access to and comparing
in every possible case the copies with the originals.
This initial Diary of Washington opens with his sixteenth
year, and plainly shows the energy and the
maturity of his judgment, and his capability to discharge
even then important trusts with efficiency.</p>

<p>Forthcoming volumes will give, in chronological
order, his co-operation in the march of events on this
continent, and his life and opinions as seen through
the writings he left. This volume must be viewed as
the work of a youth, making a few, brief and hurried
memoranda while in the depths of the forest and intended
for no eye but his own. The time is not far
distant when an edition of Washington's more important
papers will be called for in facsimile by some
one of the photogravure processes now available for
such purposes, because of the unquestionable fidelity
to the original it secures and which is approximately
arrived at in this publication.</p>

<p>This is the first systematic attempt to produce the
writings of Washington with literal exactness as to
abbreviations, the use of capitals, punctuation, spelling,
etc. It is possible that the plan pursued may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
not, at first, meet with an unqualified commendation
from the public. But if the editor does not much
mistake the desire of students, the admirers of
Washington and the demand of historians, this
method, if faithfully executed, must produce the preferred
edition of his writings.</p>

<p>A few miscellaneous pieces in Washington's youthful
handwriting are preserved in this Journal, and are
here printed with the same effort for literal accuracy
which has been bestowed upon the Journal itself,
and upon his field notes of land surveys.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<hr class="r15" />

<p class="drop-capx">This journal of George Washington, now for the
first time printed entire and with literal exactness,
was begun, as shown by the date in the opening
lines, when he was but one month over sixteen years of
age. It is his own daily record of observations during
his first remunerated employment. His proficiency
as a surveyor, and his fortitude in encountering the
hardships of the forest in this expedition were, considering
his age, truly remarkable. With him the beginning
determined the end. Biographers have made us
acquainted with the character of his worthy parents,
and with the sturdy stock from which they were descended.
It does seem as though Providence called
our Washington into being, and educated him in the
western world just at the time when a great leader
was wanted to direct a revolution, and to found on
this continent a new and a free, English-speaking
nation. Every factor, whether of lineage or culture,
in the admirably balanced character of Washington,
as well as every aspiration of his heart, from his
cradle to his grave, is of high interest to the world.
Although deprived of a father's care at the age of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
eleven years, he was, however, especially blessed in
having such a mother as the noble Mary Washington,
who conscientiously discharged her sacred duty as his
guardian, counselor and friend. Hence filial reverence
grew with his growth and strengthened with his
maturing years into fixed principles, making him
throughout all his eventful life loyal to every virtue
and heroic in every trust.</p>

<p>When George Washington set out on the enterprise
herein narrated, he was just out of school, where
he had received the best education the neighborhood
could supply, supplemented with good private instruction.
We may well believe that his mother and
his brothers then supposed that George had attained
an age and proficiency when he should either go to
college to acquire a higher education, or embark
speedily in some respectable calling; and we may
further conclude that this precocious youth was eager
to take part in the affairs of life, and deferentially
announced his preference for the latter course. Possibly
he was influenced in this selection by his great
admiration for his half-brother, Major Lawrence
Washington, who was actively and prosperously
engaged in various business enterprises, who made
much of George, and had him visit Mount Vernon
whenever it was practicable.</p>

<p>George Washington's aptitude for mathematics
early attracted the attention of his teachers, and his
beautifully kept copy-books, which are still preserved,
attest his unusual ability in mathematical demonstra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>tion
and diagrams. Mr. Williams, the principal of
the Academy in Westmoreland county, Va., where
young Washington was, to give a practical value to
this mathematical talent, had added surveying and
navigation to his other studies; and these were soon
mastered by this bright pupil. Land surveying was
then a profitable and genteel pursuit in the colonies,
and it comported well with Washington's tastes and
inclinations. While visiting his brother at Mount
Vernon, he had repeatedly amused himself and entertained
guests of the house by surveying, in their
presence, the garden, or a field, and rapidly drawing
plats of them as an exercise. A few maps of such
early surveys have been preserved. One of them, of
Lawrence Washington's turnip field, bearing date 27
Feb., 1747-8, is reproduced in fac-simile in this publication.
The others are without date, but are of about
the same period; although one, namely that of "Hell
Hole," a part of the Mount Vernon estate, and frequently
mentioned in Washington's later diaries, may
have been an earlier production. A fac-simile of it
may also be found in this work.</p>

<p>Washington's efficiency and enthusiasm as a surveyor
were observed and admired not only by his
friend and companion, George William Fairfax, but
also by the Hon. Wm. Fairfax and by Lord Fairfax,
who were constantly employing surveyors to lay off
lands for sale in the latter's large domain known as
"The Northern Neck" of Virginia. During the
early spring of 1748 the demands for surveys were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
more than usually pressing by actual settlers in the
Shenandoah valley. Lord Fairfax engaged the youth,
George Washington, to proceed with George William
Fairfax, his agent, as recorded in this journal, to execute
certain commissions and meet a pressing demand.
His surveys and reports gave entire satisfaction and
led to his steady employment by his titled patron,
principally as a director of his lordship's land office
and of the surveys, preparatory to sale. Washington
filled this position for about three years, when he was
called upon to accompany his brother Lawrence, who,
from failing health, was constrained, in the fall of
1751, to visit the West Indies in the hope of finding
relief.</p>

<p>The journal kept by George Washington during his
visit to Barbadoes in company with his brother, will
be given in a separate work soon to be issued in its
chronological order by the editor. The journal here
presented to the public is, in the main, confined to
Washington's daily entries, memoranda and field notes
of surveys of land situated between the Blue Ridge
and the Alleghany mountains.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the records of his surveys are not
consecutive, and it is quite evident that they represent
but a part, and probably but a small part, of the land
surveyed by Washington for Lord Fairfax and others.
The notes of surveys here published are all that can
be found or that are now known to exist. It is to be
hoped, however, that if other books of his field notes
of surveys have escaped destruction, they may yet be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
discovered. This hope is encouraged from the fact
that the laws of the colony required surveyors, upon
retiring from their official stations as county surveyors,
to deposit their field books of notes of surveys
with the records of the county. How far this law was
complied with, the editor is unable to say. It is a
mistake, however, to infer that Washington was constantly
employed in actually running lines and taking
field notes. He was largely charged with the supervision
of Lord Fairfax's land office, and the records
thereto belonging, and was his principal adviser in
his land surveys, directing the men employed in the
field work.</p>

<p>This journal, with its memoranda and surveys,
makes a valuable addition to our knowledge of the
life and employments of Washington in his youth.
Here are also preserved the names of nearly three
hundred of the early settlers and first land owners in
the great valley of Virginia, for whom Washington
made surveys, or who assisted him in this business.</p>

<p>It was a cherished hope of the editor that he might
be able to give, in notes, brief sketches of the pioneers
in the valley here named, through the assistance of
their descendants, who, in many instances, reside upon
lands surveyed by Washington for their ancestors.
In this, however, he has been disappointed.</p>

<p>The journal, memoranda and surveys found in
these books have all been copied with literal exactness
and are here printed just as they were recorded
by the hand of their author. This literalness is ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>hered
to in the interest of truth and for the benefit
of earnest students of history unable to consult personally
the originals. Washington requires no apology
for any apparent want of style or other marks of
hasty composition in this journal. It was written in
the nature of a memorandum intended for himself
alone. His thoughts, even in these youthful productions,
flow easily and in an orderly and consecutive
manner. His sentences are never involved or obscure,
and his observations are always apt and instructive;
and, although a youth in years when this journal was
written, he was dealing ably with important interests,
and deporting himself in a manly manner, and associating
on terms of intimacy with the foremost men of
the day. He seems to have had no idle boy life, but
was a man with manly instincts and ambitions from
his youth. Time and accidents are slowly, but effectually,
destroying the precious original manuscripts,
so that a literal and authentic copy is a great desideratum.
No liberty whatever is taken by the editor
with the text as recorded by Washington. The
notes which are added, it is hoped, may prove of
interest.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Double dating of the year, as is done here, was an old custom
observed between January 1st and the 25th of March.
For all other portions of the year a single date was used. Although
January 1st had been generally accepted as the beginning
of the historical year in Christian countries, yet March
25th was held by some as the beginning of the civil or legal
year. The Gregorian chronology or new style had not, at the
time this journal was written, been adopted by England, and,
indeed, was not until September 2nd, 1752.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The party on this expedition set out from "Belvoir," the
home and plantation of the Hon. William Fairfax, described
by General Washington as "within full view of Mount Vernon,
separated by water only, is one of the most beautiful seats on
the river." (Letter to John Sinclair, 11 December, 1796.) It
was founded by William Fairfax, cousin and agent to Lord
Thomas Fairfax, and was his residence until his death in 1757.
The estate then passed to his eldest son, George William Fairfax,
also one of Lord Fairfax's agents, and was his residence
until July, 1773, when, accompanied by his wife, he went to
England to attend to some property he had inherited there.
Washington, his friend and neighbor, consented to act as his
agent during his absence, which, at the time, neither anticipated
would be of long continuance.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p>
"Law's delay" and business interests making it important
for Mr. Fairfax to remain in England, he directed Washington
to dispose of his stock, farm fixtures and household effects at
public sale. After due advertisement, this was done August
15, 1774. A second sale at "Belvoir" took place December
5, 1774.
</p>
<p>
The following bill of household effects bought at this first
sale at Belvoir by George Washington has been preserved
among his private papers and was in the possession of one of his
inheritors, Lawrence Washington, in January 1891. The bill
in the auctioneer's handwriting was folded and endorsed in
Washington's known hand:&mdash;"Articles bought by G<sup>o</sup> Washington
at Col<sup>o</sup> Fairfax's Sale 15 August 1774."

<p>
The following admirable description of the estate is taken
from an advertisement in the Pennsylvania <cite>Gazette</cite> of Philadelphia,
October 19, 1774:
</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">To be rented from year to year, or for a term of
years</span>,&mdash;Belvoir, the beautiful seat of the Honorable Geo.
W. Fairfax, Esq., upon the Potomac river, in Fairfax county,
about 14 miles below Alexandria.
</p>
<p>
"The mansion is of brick, two stories high, with four convenient
rooms, and a large passage on the lower floor; five
rooms and a large passage on the second; servants' hall and
cellar below; convenient to it are offices, stables and coach-house;
adjacent is a large and well furnished garden stored
with a great variety of fruits, all in good order.
</p>
<p>
"Appertaining to the tract on which these houses stand and
which contains near 2,000 acres (surrounded in a manner by
navigable water), are several valuable fisheries and a good deal
of clear land in different parts which may be let all together
or separately as shall be found most convenient.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>
"The terms may be known of Colonel Washington who lives
near the premises, or of me in Berkeley county.
</p>
<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Francis Willis</span>, Junior."<br />
</p>
<p>
The estate was leased to the Rev. Andrew Morton for a term
of seven years. Unfortunately the mansion was destroyed by
fire only a few years later. The owner's long absence, and the
fact that there was no house to invite a careful tenant, together
with the excitement and derangement of business incident to
the war for independence, caused the estate rapidly to depreciate
in value. Early in 1775 Washington relinquished the
agency of George W. Fairfax's business in America, as his time
was fully taken up in directing the momentous affairs of the
Revolution.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> George William Fairfax, eldest son of the Hon. William
Fairfax, of "Belvoir," Va., was born in Nassau, New Providence,
West Indies, in 1724. His father having been appointed
to the custom house in Salem, Massachusetts, he was taken to
that town and resided there until 1734, about which time his
father accepted the agency of Lord Fairfax's lands in Virginia,
and removed to that province. For a time he resided in Westmoreland
county, Va., but after a couple of years he settled
upon and developed the "Belvoir" estate on the Potomac river.
George William Fairfax was educated in England, and coming
to his majority settled at "Belvoir," and married Sarah,
daughter of Col. Wilson Cary, of Hampton, Va., who some
writers, on rather apocryphal testimony, endeavor to show was
an object of Washington's ardent devotion when a mere youth.
The same compliment has also been claimed for her sister Mary,
who married Edward Ambler, and for other belles of that
period in Virginia, as well as in some of the other colonies.
George W. Fairfax, after his marriage, resided part of the time
at "Belvoir," and part at "Greenway Court," as agent of Lord
Fairfax, in the vicinity of which he owned and cultivated
lands. On his father's death in 1757 he inherited "Belvoir,"
where he continued to reside until the summer of 1773, when,
accompanied by his wife, he went to England to look after
some property he had inherited there. The proprietors of
"Belvoir" and "Mount Vernon" and their families were always
on the most friendly terms, as the letters extant of each
attest, and Washington's diaries fully confirm. Mr. Fairfax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
favored the early protests by the colonies and petitions to the
king in the interests of the colonies, but opposed measures looking
to forcible resistance. Washington consented to act as his
agent while he was absent, presuming his stay in England would
be of short duration. But a complication of matters detained
him abroad so that he instructed his agent to sell off his stock
at "Belvoir" and lease the property. A sale was accordingly
held on the estate in August, 1774, which continued two days.
A second and further sale was held in December the same
year. The property was leased in 1774 for seven years, but
shortly after this the mansion house was burned down and never
rebuilt. During the Revolutionary war some of Mr. Fairfax's
property in Fairfax county was escheated to the state. His loss
of income from America led him to limit his expense, he therefore
removed from Yorkshire to Bath and lived in a modest
way, dividing generously, from his limited means, with the
American prisoners of war held in England. He had no children.
A friendly correspondence was kept up between him
and Washington to the close of his life. He was urged to return
to America, but his mansion at "Belvoir" having been destroyed
by fire he kept putting it off and never returned. He
left "Belvoir" and some other landed property to Ferdinand,
son of his half-brother, Rev. Bryan Fairfax, and died at Bath in
England, April 3, 1787, and was buried in Wirthlington church.
His will appointed George Washington as one of his executors.
His wife survived him until 1812. Her remains were placed
by the side of her husband's.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> George Neville, Esq., was among the earliest planters to
settle in the western part of Prince William county, Va. As
early as, or before 1730, he selected a large body of desirable
land lying on the main road by way of Ashby's Gap from
Fredericksburg to Winchester. Here his residence was beautifully
situated on high, healthy and productive land near the
head springs of Bull Run, a tributary of the Occoquan river,
and 34 miles from Fredericksburg, the head of tide water on
the Rappahannock river. Squire Neville, the proprietor of this
fine estate, as he was usually called, was a man of steady and
industrious habits, possessed a fine constitution, gentle in his
manners, and cultured in his tastes, enterprising and thrifty,
with a genius for overcoming such difficulties as always beset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the path of the pioneer in a new country. As the lands to the
west of him, and particularly those in the Shenandoah valley
beyond the Blue Ridge, began to attract settlers the travel on
the road past his house became considerable, and as a matter of
accommodation to the public he opened an ordinary and kept
a store for general merchandizing. Neville's Ordinary was a
land mark, and is to be found on Fry and Jefferson's Map of
Virginia, as well as on Governor Pownall's and other early maps
of Virginia. In 1750 Washington surveyed for Mr. Neville
400 acres of land. By marriage George Neville was related to
the Fairfax family of Virginia. His wife, Ann Burroughs, was
a cousin to Lord Thomas Fairfax of "Greenway Court," the proprietor
of the Northern Neck of Virginia. Squire Neville and
his wife were blessed with a numerous family of healthy sons
and daughters, who inherited the sturdy virtues of their parents,
and who founded families for themselves, and whose descendants
are to be found throughout the southern and western
states. Joseph Neville, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'son of Geerge'">son of George</ins>, was a prosperous
planter in the western part of Prince William county, Va., in
1760. (See Washington's Diary.) He served as a colonel in the
Revolution, was one of the commissioners for running the
boundary line between Pennsylvania and Virginia, and was a
member of Congress 1793-5; died in Hardy county, Va., 1819.
John Neville, another son, was colonel of the 4th Virginia
regiment in the Revolution, and brigadier-general in the Pennsylvania
militia at the close of the war. He was born in Virginia
26 July, 1731. From his youth he had a fondness for
military affairs and served in the Braddock expedition, and also
in the Dunmore Indian war. He and his brothers were early
and life-long friends of General Washington, the acquaintance
beginning when they were youths. At an early date John
Neville took up considerable tracts of land in Frederick and
Augusta counties, Va. He resided for some years in the
Shenandoah valley, being at one time sheriff of Frederick
county. He also acquired large tracts of land on Chartier's
creek in Pennsylvania, and had built himself a house preparatory
to taking up his residence there, when the Revolutionary
war began, in which he took an active and honorable part.
This event postponed, for some years, his removal with his
family to Pennsylvania. On the 24th August, 1754, he was
united in marriage to Winifred Oldham, by whom he had two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
children, a son and a daughter, Presley and Amelia. Presley
Neville married Nancy, daughter of General Daniel Morgan,
and they became the progenitors of the large and influential
family of Nevilles of Pittsburg, Pa. Colonel Presley Neville,
as he was called, served in the Revolution for three years on
the staff of General Lafayette. Amelia Neville married Major
Isaac Craig of the Revolution, and they became the founders
of the well known and esteemed family of Craigs of Pittsburg.&mdash;<cite>Eagle's

the United States. The name properly restricted however, applies
especially to that portion of the Appalachian range south
of the Potomac river. In some parts of Pennsylvania it is
known as Kittatinny and at some places in Maryland as South
Mountain. It attains its greatest altitude in Virginia at the
Peaks of Otter, which are about 4,000 feet above sea level.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Capt. Ashby resided on the Shenandoah river above Burwell's
island and the great bend of that stream, at which place
he maintained a ferry and kept a house of entertainment. It
was on the natural line by which travel came from the tide-water
region of Virginia, through a gap in the Blue Ridge and
across the Shenandoah valley to the country beyond. Being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
man of great courage and usefulness, he was deservedly popular
among the early settlers, and his name was given not only
to his ordinary but also to the gap and to the ferry. There
was, too, a Fort Ashby on Patterson creek, near the town of
Frankfort. There are numerous families bearing the name of
Ashby throughout the southern and western states, who are
probably descendants of this famous pioneer. General Turner
W. Ashby, an officer of distinction in the Confederate army, is
presumably of this family. The name still attaches to the gap
in the mountains, but it has been superseded at the old ferry.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Shenandoah river&mdash;this is the largest tributary of the Potomac.
The name is of Indian origin, and in the aboriginal
language is said to signify "the daughter of the stars." Kercheval,
in his History of the Valley of Virginia, says the name
was first written Gerando, then Sherandoch, and now we have
Shenandoah. The river has its head in Augusta county near
the divide where the head-waters of the James river take their
rise. The Shenandoah flows for about 170 miles through a
broad valley over a limestone bed between the North mountain
on the one side and the Blue Ridge on the other, to the Potomac
river at Harper's Ferry. This valley was the theater of
many important military operations during the late war. The
name of Sherando is perpetuated in the name of a post-office in
Augusta county on the head-waters of the Shenandoah.</p></div>

Frederick county, Virginia, on the 12th of December, 1781.
His remains were interred within the Episcopal church of Winchester,
Va. His residence and other improvements were familiarly
called "Quarters" and "Hunting Lodge," chiefly because
he had in contemplation the erection of a commodious
mansion. Lord Fairfax was the son of Thomas, 5th Lord Fairfax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and his wife Catherine, daughter of Lord Culpeper, once
governor of Virginia. He was educated at Oxford and afterward
held a commission in the British army. He was a fine
scholar, and is said to have been a contributor to <cite>The Spectator</cite>.
He succeeded to his father's title and to his mother's extensive
landed estate known as the "Northern Neck of Virginia," lying
between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers and estimated
at 5,700,000 acres. For some years after coming into
possession of this property it was left in the hands of agents.
He finally employed his cousin, the Hon. William Fairfax, son
of Henry and Anne (Harrison) Fairfax, as his agent in the
management of his lands. About 1739 Lord Fairfax first
visited his estate in America. For a year he devoted himself
to becoming thoroughly acquainted with his possessions and
then returned to England. Four years later, in 1745, he returned
to this country and for a time made his home at "Belvoir,"
the seat of his relative and agent.
</p>
<p>
A branch office for the sale of lands in the valley of Virginia,
had been opened in Frederick county in 1742. The main office
and records, however, were not removed from "Belvoir" until
1761.
</p>
<p>
Lord Fairfax built for himself a stone lodge with quarters
for his servants, reserving around it a manor of 10,000 acres
which he called "Greenway Court." The lodge was about
twelve miles south-east of Winchester, at which place he purposed
to build a castle, but this was never erected. His lodge
was, however, sufficiently spacious for him to live in comfortably,
and exercise a generous hospitality. He possessed a
good library and was frequently visited by men of note whom
he entertained in an elegant manner. He was fond of the
chase and took an active interest in the management of his
estate, as well as in the affairs of the colony, as his letters fully
prove. He identified himself with the people as far as was
practicable, and was deservedly popular. He served as lieutenant
of Frederick county in the militia organizations; presided
as one of the judges in the county courts at Winchester,
and was an overseer of the public roads.
</p>
<p>
He met at "Belvoir," George Washington, when a youth,
and, pleased with his energy and talents, employed him to
survey lands beyond the Blue Ridge, which were to be sold.
This was Washington's first remunerated employment. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
acquaintance thus begun, ripened into a friendship that was
cherished by both through life.
</p>
<p>
Although a frank loyalist, his age and prudence in refraining
from all participation in the Revolutionary struggle, protected
him from being interfered with either by the government or
by his neighbors. He died at the age of ninety-three, before
peace was restored. His barony and its prerogatives, according
to English law, descended, in the absence of a son, to his eldest
brother, Robert, who thus became 7th Lord Fairfax. The
latter died in Leeds Castle, England, 1791, without a son.
The baronial title then fell to the Rev. Bryan Fairfax, of
"Towlston Hall," Fairfax county, Va., who died 7 August,
1802. The great landed estates with their entails were, however,
in effect confiscated by the success of the Revolution.
The Legislature of Virginia in 1785 passed an act in relation to
the "Northern Neck" to the following effect. "And be it
further enacted, that the land holders within the said district
of the Northern Neck shall be for ever hereafter exhonorated
and discharged from composition and quit rents, any laws, customs
or usage, to the contrary notwithstanding." Revised Code
of the Laws of Virginia, vol. 1, p. 351, 2, 3. "Greenway Court"
was devised by his lordship to his nephew, Rev. Denny Martin,
residing in England, on condition of his obtaining the consent of
Parliament to change his name to Fairfax. This was done, and
he was afterward known as "Denny, Lord Fairfax." Like his
uncle, he left no children and therefore bequeathed the estate to
two maiden sisters in England. The legatees of the Fairfax
estate sold their interest to Chief Justice John Marshall,
Raleigh Colston, Esq. and General Henry Lee. They divided
it up and sold it out in small farms, and quieted the titles. It
is believed that no part of this vast body of Fairfax land is now
held by any member of the family.&mdash;<cite>Sparks, Drake and
others.</cite></p></div>

1732 with his family, settled on the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Opequan creek'">Opequon creek</ins> about five
miles south of the town of Winchester. The year before he
had bought from John and Isaac Van Meter a warrant for
nearly 40,000 acres of land in the Shenandoah valley which
they had obtained from Governor Gooch of Virginia in 1730.
Capt. Hite brought with him from Pennsylvania sixteen
families, all of whom settled in the same vicinity on fine arable
ground. They were all judges of good lands and devoted to
agriculture. The descendants of Hite are quite numerous
throughout the southern and south-western states, and many
farms in the valley are still held under titles derived from him.
Kercheval says, Joist Hite built a stone house <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'on the Opecquan'">on the Opequon</ins>
shortly after his coming to the valley. It is still standing
and has a very ancient appearance though there are no discoverable
marks to fix the date. On the wall plate of a frame
barn, however, built by Hite, the figures "1747" are plainly
marked and can still be read.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> "Frederick Town," properly Winchester, is the capital of
Frederick county, Va. The latter was formed out of Orange
county by Act of Assembly of Virginia in 1738, at the same
time that Augusta county was formed. The choice of this site
for the capital of the county was determined by the simple fact
that a few hardy, adventurous Indian traders, as early as 1732
or even before that date, had built themselves cabins at this
point known as the "Big Shawane Springs." These settlers
gradually attracted others until a village was developed. This
spring or one near it, an example of the great springs which are
to be found in most limestone regions, furnishes the town of
Winchester, to the present time, with an abundant supply of
pure potable water. The site of the town was, all things considered,
well chosen, in a fertile region and on the line of travel,
whether across the valley to the Alleghany mountains and the
waters of the Ohio river beyond, or along the great valley of
the Shenandoah. James Wood was the projector of the town
of Winchester, which was incorporated in 1752 by the Assembly
of Virginia. However, twenty-six lots had been laid out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and sold by James Wood prior to this. Lord Fairfax
shortly after this date made an addition to the town, and donated
the ground for an Episcopal church. Frederick county
early took measures to give protection to its settlers by building
forts, making roads and establishing ferries. Its productive soil
at the same time bountifully rewarded the husbandman for his
labor. As the Frederick county courts were held at Winchester,
the people adopted the southern habit of calling the place
where the courts met by the name of the county, thus it was
frequently spoken of as Frederick Town and is so designated
in several of the early maps. Fort Loudoun was erected here
by direction of the Assembly of Virginia in 1756, under the
immediate supervision of Major Washington.</p></div>

Washington's "Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour," p. 14,
Washington's association with frontiersmen in their primitive
cabins, which the position of a surveyor in the then almost
unbroken forest necessitated, was to him a new and peculiar
experience. His observations and reflections of the first few
days are recorded with a naivete which is truly charming.</p></div>

remoteness and the difficulty of access to them, with the competition

A settlement sprang up about the springs at an early date,

Bath, and was made the county seat when, in 1820, the county

cottage and stables, and passed summers here with his family.

was born in Skipton, Yorkshire, England, and at the age
of about fifteen came to America. Some five years later he
resided at Havre-de-Grace, Md., where he married a Miss Johnson.
Removing thence to Wright's Ferry, opposite the town
of Columbia, where he obtained a Maryland title to a 500 acre
tract of land called "Peach Bottom," and built himself a small
stone house. The land, however, was on disputed territory,
and claimants under the laws of Pennsylvania finally dispossessed
him. His next move was to a locality in what is now
Washington county, Md., where he located and settled upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
tract of 1,400 acres on the Antietam creek, called "Long
Meadows," and began trading with the Indians. After collecting
a large lot of furs and skins he shipped them to England
but was financially ruined through the capture of the vessel
by the French. Unable to repay money he had borrowed
from Mr. Dulany, of Maryland, he gave up to him his land,
and moved farther west, built a cabin a few miles above the
junction of the north and south branches of the Potomac, on
the Maryland side, at a place which became known as "Old
Town," but which he called Skipton, the name of his Yorkshire
birthplace. This frontier spot became his permanent
residence, where he eventually owned a large body of land on
both sides of the Potomac. From his familiarity with the Indians
and their habits and character, he was enabled to carry
on with great advantage his trade with them and in time became
the most important frontiersman of his day in Maryland.
He took part with the Washingtons, Lee, Mason and others in
the formation and early operations of "The Ohio Company,"
and in all matters of dealing with the Indians and prospecting
for wild lands was the Company's chief dependence. With
the aid of Namacolin, a noted Indian hunter, he laid out the
first road over the Alleghany mountains to the head-waters of
the Ohio. Gen. Braddock's expedition, and later the National
road, followed nearly the same route. The attention attracted
to the Ohio region through this Company's explorations, made
it increasingly important to both England and France to possess
and control the lands beyond the Ohio. This vigilance
precipitated the war that drove out the French and secured to
England and America the vast dominion known as the Northwest.

<p>
Col. Cresap's literary acquirements were small, but he had a
vigorous mind, strong common sense, and was not deficient
in practical self-education. He was one of the surveyors of
Prince George's county which, at that period, embraced all the
western part of Maryland. January 1, 1745, he surveyed for
Gov. Thomas Bladen "Walnut Bottom" just below the mouth
of Wills creek. He frequently represented his county in the
Legislature and being noted for his clear understanding, sound
judgment, firmness and courage, was esteemed one of the best
legislators his county ever had. He was of medium stature,
firmly set, of sound constitution, and lived to the uncommon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
age of 105 or 106. He was twice married, the second time at
the age of 80; by his first wife he had five children; three
sons, Daniel, Thomas and Michael, and two daughters, Sarah
and Elizabeth. Captain Michael Cresap was the person upon
whom Thomas Jefferson fixed the stigma of the murder of the
relatives of Logan. Jefferson having transmitted the pathetic
speech of the Indian chief to the Abbe Raynal as an evidence
of the original power of oratory of the aboriginal American, it
is claimed more in a spirit of literary conceit than of conviction;
however he failed during his life to correct the injustice done
Cresap, although he was repeatedly furnished with the evidence
exculpating Cresap and fixing the barbarous act on one Great-house.
At his home, Col. Cresap dispensed, for his time and
means, a generous hospitality to all callers, in a region where,
as yet, no public houses were to be found. He kept a big
kettle ready suspended to place a fire under, near a spring for
the use of the Indians who often passed his place, and for this
reason they designated him the "Big Spoon." Lord Baltimore
employed him to run a survey of the western line of Maryland,
and to ascertain which of the two branches of the Potomac
was the largest. His autograph map of this survey is still
preserved in the archives of the state of Maryland.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> The South Branch of the Potomac, of which the Indian
name was Wappotomaka, rises in Pendleton county, West Virginia,
among the spurs of the Alleghany and North mountains,
and meets the North Branch about 20 miles below Cumberland,
Md. The latter branch has been accepted as the dividing
line between Maryland and Virginia, although now known to
be neither as long nor as large as the South Branch. A line
drawn due north from the extreme head-waters of the South
Branch would run ten miles to the west of a parallel line from
the head springs of the North Branch, thus proving the loss by
Maryland of this strip of territory, as well as the region between
the two branches, had the South Branch been taken instead
of the North Branch as the main river referred to in the
Royal Charter, and made the line separating the contiguous
colonies. The valley through which the South Branch flows
is broad and its lands very fertile, causing them to be much
sought after for farms by the hardy pioneers in the early days
before the Revolution. It was then familiarly known as the
"upper tract" of Virginia.</p>

head, and embracing all the hairy integuments and flattened
muscles from the back of the skull to the brow above the
eyes. Taking the scalp of an enemy, living or dead, has been
held from remote times as a special sign of victory and token
of triumph. The North American Indians, particularly during
the early colonial wars, took the scalps of their enemies, preserving
and exhibiting them with savage pride and occasionally
wearing them as decorations and trophies. The assembly of
Virginia, in 1755, established a reward of £10 for every scalp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of a male Indian above the age of twelve (Hening's Statutes,
vol. VI, p. 551). In 1757 this sum was raised to £15, and £30
more for every scalp taken within the next two years (Hening,
VII, p. 122). Maryland and Pennsylvania also offered rewards
for Indian scalps.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> The war dance of the Indians probably had a significance
to their minds not understood by civilized man, and was not to
them the meaningless custom it seems to us. It has frequently
been described and painted by eye-witnesses. In 1857 Virtue,
Emmins &amp; Co. copyrighted a very effective engraving of a war
dance in the forest, arranged from Washington's description of
it in this journal.</p></div>

which, at first view, appear natural or common to all mankind.
This, however, is not the fact. That there was a period in the
history of our race when the knife and fork were unknown to
the furnishings of the table, cannot well be doubted; and there
was even a time when the table itself was not deemed an
essential. At the present day the idea of eating a meal at
table without the accompaniment of a knife and fork would
excite disgust; their absence, however, in a remote Virginia
mountain cabin in 1747-8 as here recorded, simply shows that
they had not been provided nor deemed essential to the life of
a hunter, not an ignorance of their use, as the two-pronged,
iron, table fork was in common use at that period throughout
the settlements in all the American colonies. It is nevertheless
true that the knife and fork now deemed so necessary at table,
are a much more modern convenience than is generally supposed.
The king of Hungary, Coevinus, toward the close of
the fifteenth century, as related by Galeotus Martius, ate his
meat with his fingers as did all the guests at table. In Italy,
the fork was, to a limited extent, in use at this time among
the nobility. In France, at the end of the sixteenth century,
forks were comparatively new at court. The use of the table
fork is referred to in "<cite>Washington's Rules of Civility and
Decent Behaviour</cite>," and in Hawkins' Youths' Companion, the
source of these rules printed about 1650. The knife is perhaps
one of the most ancient of instruments, it was made of different
metals and in a great variety of forms. The table knife was,
however, contemporary with the fork. According to Chamberlin
it was first made in England, in 1563. The use of the fork
at table spread to Europe from Venice, in Italy. In 1608 it
was brought to England by Thomas Coryate who, while traveling,
observed its use in Italy and continued it himself on his
return to England. (See his work entitled "Crudities.") It
is rather disappointing that neither the Greeks nor Romans
have even a name for the table fork. The flesh fork, called
<em>creagra</em>, with a long handle, for cooks to take meat out of a
boiling pot, was known and used by the Hebrews and the
Greeks. But had the table fork been used by the latter or by
the Romans, some specimens would have been found among
those extensive ruins which have been so carefully explored by
modern investigators. It is known that some articles have
been found, the use of which conjecture assigns to the table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
but they are not forks and the surmise is not generally credited.
The Chinese, who claim to have led the rest of the world in
most of the economic inventions, seem to have overlooked the
table fork and do not even now use it in cutting or conveying
food to the mouth but employ in its stead the "chop sticks"
which, it must be said in their praise, they use with skill and
dexterity. It should be stated that large bronze forks were
used by the Egyptians in presenting offerings to the gods. It
is unpleasant to represent the tables of our ancestors of a few
centuries back as without forks, yet this certainly was the fact.
The silver table fork, which also had its evolution from two to
four prongs, was first manufactured in 1662 by Heylin.
</p>
<p>
The small knife, formerly worn by gentlemen at their girdles,
was used by them, not only as a weapon of defense, but also
as an article of convenience in cutting their meat. However,
the ancient custom of serving food at table was to have a servant
cut meats and other food into small morsels before distributing
it to guests. The wealthy employed a person whose
special duty it was to carve the meats into proper and convenient
pieces and his was the only knife in the dining hall.
When the fork was first introduced into England, its employment
was ridiculed as an effeminate practice, as may be seen
in the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, and others where the
persons using it are referred to as "your fork-carving-traveler."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Henry Van Metre or Meter.&mdash;There was a numerous
family of the Van Meters in Virginia and they were among the
earliest settlers in the valley of the Shenandoah, on the South
Branch and along the upper Potomac. Kercheval, in his History
of the Valley of Virginia, says this family came from New
York and New Jersey. It is evident that they were people of
energy and thrift, judges of good land. At a period antedating
the settlements in the valley, it is stated by this historian
that a John Van Meter, a sort of wandering Indian trader, of
New York, accompanied the Delaware Indians in a war party
against the Catawbas; but the Catawbas anticipating the attack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
surprised and defeated the Delawares in a battle fought near
where the present court-house of Pendleton stands. John Van
Meter escaped and returned to New York, but he was so impressed
with the beauty and fertility of the lands on the South
Branch bottom in Hardy county, that he advised his sons to secure
lands and locate there. Of these sons, Isaac became a man of
note and frequently represented Hardy county in the House of
Delegates of Virginia. He was a member of the Virginia Convention
of 1788 which ratified the Federal Constitution. In
1730, it is a matter of history that John and Isaac Van Metre,
brothers, obtained from Gov. Gooch, of Virginia, a warrant for
40,000 acres of land to be located west of the mountains. This
warrant, or a part of it, they sold to Joist Hite. A number of
tracts on the original warrant were surveyed in the vicinity of
Shepherdstown. The name of Van Meter is still frequently met
with throughout West Virginia and has its monument in a
stream forming the north-western boundary line of Jefferson
county and emptying into the Potomac, and named on the
maps of Virginia Van Meter's Marsh. A controversy as to
the validity of the Van Metre patent was raised in 1738 by
Lord Fairfax and taken into the courts for adjudication. Lord
Fairfax contending that his grants covered the whole of the
western end of the northern neck, while the holders claimed
that the governor, under authority from the crown, had disposing
power. This conflict as to title was a source of much litigation,
and was not finally settled until after the Revolution,
when all the parties to the original suits were dead.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> The wild turkey.&mdash;This is the largest and finest of our
game birds and, although native to North America, it bears a
foreign name from the following circumstances. Specimens
of the living bird, as well as its eggs, were sent by the early
Jesuit missionaries to the old world on Spanish and Portuguese
ships, entering Europe through Portugal. It was as yet unnamed,
and was at first referred to by writers of that period
merely as the "Jesuit bird." As it became known, the demand
for the stranger was supplied chiefly from Turkey where, for
some reason, it thrived exceedingly well, and in time it came
to be familiarly spoken of as "the turkey." Gradually becoming
tame, and proving to be quite prolific, it was recognized as a
great addition to the luxuries of the table. Speedily becoming
a favorite in every country to which it was taken, the great forests
and game preserves throughout Europe were gradually stocked
with it and it was also raised as a domestic fowl. To-day the
American turkey, derived as stated, is found wild in all the
great forests of the old world, while the domesticated bird is
abundantly raised everywhere in Europe for the markets. In
ancient times, we are told, the choicest game fowls brought to
a feast were pheasants and peacocks. Emigrants to America
brought over with them the domesticated bird to its native land,
but under a borrowed name. Washington, in his journal,
April 7, 1748, records the fact that one of his men that day
had killed a wild turkey weighing 20 pounds. The domesticated
bird, when permitted to attain the age of two or three
years, and being well fed during the winter months, often
reaches the weight of 30 pounds or more. As marking in a
degree the devastation of the late war and the enforced abandonment
of plantations in the section of Virginia adjacent to
the city of Washington, it is a fact worthy of record, that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
1876 the newspapers chronicled the news that the thickets and
pine forests which were grown up since the armies left were
tenanted by wild deer and turkeys; foxes, etc. And to this
day, December 25, 1890, wild turkeys are brought to the
Washington market killed in Fairfax county, Va., within ten
miles of Washington city.&mdash;<cite>Gentlemen's Magazine.</cite></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Manor line.&mdash;In colonial times there were a number of
manors, or great landed estates, granted under the then existing
laws of England, to persons of note and quality in Virginia and
in some of the other provinces. Holders of such estates enjoyed
special rights and privileges. Manors were formerly called
baronies and entitled the rightful possessor to lordships, and
such lord or baron was empowered to hold domestic courts for
redressing misdemeanors, nuisances and settling disputes among
tenants. Among the manors of limited privileges in Virginia
may be enumerated the "manor of Greenway Court," with a
domain of 10,000 acres. The great "manor of Leeds," which
has figured so extensively in the courts of Virginia, contained
150,000 acres within the counties of Culpeper, Fauquier and
Frederick. The "South Branch manor," in Hardy county,
embraced 55,000 acres; "Paterson Creek manor," in Hampshire
county, 9,000 acres; and "Goony Run manor," adjoining
that of Leeds and lying chiefly in Shenandoah county, 13,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
acres. "Beverley's manor," for the most part in Augusta
county, consisted of 118,411 acres, and "Fairfax manor," in
Hampshire, of 10,000 acres. There were still other manors in
different parts of the state. In New York under the Dutch
government the baron or proprietor of the manor lands was
called the patroon.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> Clay lick.&mdash;Names of places or streams with the word <em>lick</em>
either prefixed or affixed to them, such as "Salt lick," "Blue
lick," "Grass lick," "Licking creek," etc., were usually given
in consequence of the presence of some saline matter in the
springs, streams or soil which attracted the wild animals and
caused them to lick for the salt. Hunters in new settlements
often built what they called <em>blinds</em> near these licks in which to
conceal themselves, and waited there for the game to come, as
they were pretty sure to do, almost daily, and at times in considerable
numbers, when they could be readily killed.</p></div>

Indian name for the South Branch of the Potomac. This
stream courses through a fine valley from its head-springs in
Pendleton county, and has many considerable branches rising
among the spurs of the Alleghany mountains on the one side
and the North or Cacapehon (Capon) mountain on the other,
the latter separating it from the valley of Virginia on the east.
The great or most noted fork of the South Branch is at Morefield
in Hardy county. Washington surveyed much of the
land in that section. The young farmers seeking good lands
had come in taken up considerable tracts and built improvements
before surveys were made or any effort to prove rights
from either Lord Fairfax or the governor of Virginia.</p>

the tract of land so designated is neither claimed by an actual
occupant or occupied by virtue of any official record. Many of
the settlers on the lands of Lord Fairfax selected their farms
and made improvements without any legal survey, warrant or
title, other than a "tomahawk blaze" for a boundary mark,
trusting that the actual owner of the land would recognize the
improvement and occupant's claim and deal justly by them.
These "tomahawk claims" were respected by the actual settlers,
had a market value among land speculators and were admitted,
to a certain extent, as evidence of rights in the courts.</p></div>

in the Shenandoah valley, of German immigrants and
their descendants, who had first settled in Pennsylvania and
then removed to, and taken up lands in, the valley of Virginia.
They selected, chiefly, the good limestone lands with their centers
of population near the head-waters of the Opequon creek,
in Shenandoah, and the south-western part of Frederick county.
They were all Protestants in religion. The town of Woodstock
was originally and exclusively settled by Germans. The
bill for its incorporation was reported to the House of Burgesses
of Va., by Col. George Washington in 1761. For many years
the German language was exclusively spoken in their settlement,
and German customs and religious observances were retained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
with tenacity, their remoteness and seclusion securing
to them almost perfect freedom from innovations. The Revolution
found them patriotic supporters of the colony as against
the pretensions of Great Britain. It was in the town of Woodstock,
Shenandoah county, that Maj.-Gen. John Peter Gabriel
Muhlenberg, minister of the Lutheran church, dressed in his
uniform and with his sword buckled on, preached a farewell
sermon in 1776, to a sympathizing and patriotic congregation,
and the next day marched as colonel at the head of his German
regiment, known subsequently as the 8th Virginia, to join the
Continental army. Such names of places as Strasburg, Hamburg,
Mecklenburg, the latter now known as Shepherdstown,
etc., perpetuate the fact that many of the earliest settlers in
that section were German.&mdash;See Kercheval, p. 158.</p></div>

to proclaim and identify certain routes or lines. The "blaze"
is made by removing with an axe a strip of the outer bark of a
tree or sapling, for about a foot in length and well into the
inner bark. In the future growth of the tree a lighter color
marks the cicatrix which rarely ever wholly disappears. Surveyors,
to distinguish corner trees in a survey, not only blaze
the sides of the tree in the direction their lines run but cut
three small notches through the bark which will remain distinct
during the life of the tree.</p></div>

timberless tracts of land on the mountains and in the great
valleys of Virginia and Pennsylvania, in regions which were
generally, prior to the occupation and the clearing up of the
country by the white man, densely covered with trees. Large
tracts of such timberless land existed in the region now embraced
within the counties of Berkeley, Jefferson and Frederick.
Strange as it may appear some of this kind of land within the
history of the settlement of the valley became covered with
young forest timber. In some respects these openings resembled
the treeless prairies of the west. No satisfactory explanation
of this frequently observed condition has ever been given.
Many of these meadows were the favorite pasturing grounds of
the large game and were, therefore, of special interest to the hunter.
Clearfield county, Pa., it is believed, got its name from
the fact that there were within its territory extensive natural
clear fields and meadows.</p></div>

was the second child and oldest surviving son of Augustine
and his first wife Jane (Butler) Washington, born at Pope's
Creek, Westmoreland county, Va., in 1718, and died at his
residence, Mount Vernon, 26th July, 1752. He was the half-brother
of the illustrious George Washington and great-grandson
of the emigrant, Col. John Washington, who came to Virginia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>about 1657. It is a matter of tradition that Lawrence
was at about the age of 15 sent to England to be educated, and
leaving college he received a captain's commission to serve in
a regiment raised in Virginia to take part in the expedition
against Carthegenia, 1740-42, under the command of Admiral
Vernon.
</p>
<p>
The expedition failed of its purpose, and Major Lawrence
Washington returned to Virginia in the fall of 1742. He shortly
after became engaged to Anne Fairfax, which induced him to resign
from the army. His father died April 12, 1743, leaving a
considerable estate and named him, his oldest son, one of
his executors. He inherited from his father "the Hunting
creek" plantation, consisting of 2,500 acres, on the Potomac
but a few miles from and in sight of "Belvoir." On the 19th
of July Lawrence Washington was united in marriage to Anne,
eldest daughter of the Hon. William Fairfax of "Belvoir." He
made many improvements on his plantation and gave it the
name of "Mount Vernon," in compliment to his old commander,
Admiral Vernon. Lawrence Washington had received
a good education, had mixed with prominent personages, had
seen much of the world, and was a man of good habits and
business qualifications.
</p>
<p>
His father at the time of his death, was largely engaged in
business which Lawrence was obliged to look after and close up.
This gradually led him into various business enterprises; such
as the manufacturing of iron, buying and selling land, etc. He
and his brother Augustin were among the organizers of "The
Ohio Company," to explore the western country, encourage settlements,
and conduct a trade with the Indians. He was elected
to the House of Burgesses of Virginia from Fairfax county in
1748. It was largely through his influence that a charter was
granted to the towns of Alexandria and Colchester, both in
Fairfax county. He together with Lord Fairfax, George
Mason, Hon. William Fairfax, William Ramsay, John Carlyle
and others was named as trustee to lay out and govern the town.
He was a popular legislator, but declined to serve longer in
the Assembly, as it interfered with his present business. He
was greatly attached to his brother George, and made it a point
to have him with him at Mount Vernon whenever it was practicable
without interrupting his studies. Lawrence was always
of a delicate constitution, but by his prudent habits and systematic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
attention to business he accomplished a great deal and enhanced
the value of his possessions. He was tall in stature and
a man of fine personal appearance, as is shown by an oil painting
of him which still hangs upon the wall of the Virginia
room in Mount Vernon mansion. He was rapidly becoming
one of the leading business men of Virginia, when his health
broke down. As a last resort his physicians recommended that
he should spend a winter in the West Indies. In the fall of
1751, he resigned his commission as one of the adjutant-generals
of Virginia, and taking his brother George with him, he went
to the Island of Barbadoes. His pulmonary trouble had progressed
too far to be arrested, and after spending some five
months on the Island, and finding himself declining he returned
home and died in July, 1752. His marriage had been
blessed by four children, three of whom had died, his surviving
child, Sarah, was still an infant at the time of her father's
death. After providing in his will for his wife he left Mount
Vernon to his daughter, but in the event of her death without
heirs it was to go to his "beloved brother George," who was
also named as one of his executors. This daughter Sarah died
within a year, and George inherited Mount Vernon before he
was 21 years of age. A few years after Lawrence Washington's
death, his widow married George Lee, brother to the father of
Arthur and Richard Henry Lee, patriots in the Revolution.</p></div>

in 1738, out of Orange county at the same time that
Augusta county was created. The boundaries of Frederick
county were measurably well defined; to Augusta, however,
was left all the western territory belonging to Virginia, much
of it at that time an unexplored wilderness. This immense
area has since been divided and now forms four great and independent
states of the Union, namely, Kentucky, Indiana,
Ohio and Illinois. Frederick county, by a return of the
effective militia made to the governor of Virginia in 1777, had
but 923 men. The total population of the town of Winchester
at that time was 800 and a fraction.&mdash;<cite>Kercheval</cite>.</p></div>

youthful companion. Even to the close of his life it was the
habit of Washington, in writing important letters and papers,
to make rough drafts of them as a study. However, in copying
them off, he frequently changed expressions and amplified
their contents as his judgment approved. The original drafts
of many of his letters are preserved in the Department of State
at Washington and illustrate this fact. Hence the transcripts
in his letter-book are not always true copies of either his drafts
or his original autograph letters. These drafts were kept by
him as memoranda, rather than as exact copies. It is also probable
that there are many drafts preserved of letters which were
never actually sent. In some cases he endorses this fact upon
drafts of letters.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> The young lady indicated was Miss Mary Cary, the daughter
of Colonel Wilson Cary, of Ceeleys Hampton, Elisabeth
City county, Va. For 34 years Mr. Cary was collector of customs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
for the lower James river district, and a man of large
wealth and aristocratic notions. He had four daughters: Sarah,
who married George W. Fairfax, of "Belvoir"; Mary, who
married in 1754, Edward Ambler of Jamestown; Anna, who
married Robert Carter Nicholas; and Elizabeth, who married
Rev. Bryan, 8th Lord Fairfax. Col. Cary had also one son
Wilson Miles Cary, who was a member of the Convention of
Virginia in 1776. Some writers have confounded him with
his father. Bishop Meade in his <cite>Old Churches and Families
of Virginia</cite>, accepts traditions which other writers claim are
authenticated by documents, preserved by the Ambler family,
and accordingly his account credits the story that Washington,
in his youth, was an ardent admirer of Miss Mary Cary, and
solicited leave of Col. Cary to address his daughter, but was refused.
(See <cite>Meade</cite>, vol. i, 108.) This draft of the letter addressed
to "Dear Friend Robin," was probably made in the
spring of 1748, when Washington was in his seventeenth year.
In it, he playfully avows an admiration for the "lowland
beauty" and, at the same time, admits the agreeableness of the
"young lady in the house" with him at "Belvoir." Mr.
Edward Ambler, educated at Cambridge, England, was collector
for York river and a burgess for Jamestown. He died
in 1768 in his thirty-fifth year and was buried at Jamestown;
his widow survived him until 1781. Mrs. Ambler with her
children and her sister, Mrs. Fairfax, were occasionally guests
at Mount Vernon, as Washington's diaries show. I am inclined
to believe that while it is true that Washington entertained a
high regard for the Cary family and particularly the ladies,
there is nothing but the lightest gossip to create an inference
that there ever was even an incipient affair of the heart between
either of the Misses Cary and Washington.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_52_52" id="Footnote_52_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> Lowland beauty.&mdash;Who this object of Washington's
early admiration was, if she had a veritable existence, is not
positively known. Irving, followed by Everett and others,
accepts the tradition, or rather surmises, that this sobriquet referred
to Miss Lucy Grymes of Westmoreland county, who in
1753 married Henry Lee, Esq. Their son was the gallant
General Henry Lee, "Lighthorse Harry," of the Revolution.
Some recent writers, affect to believe that this draft of a letter
is conclusive that there was a real love affair but that Betsy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Fauntleroy, of Fredericksburg, Va., was the person referred
to, and have published a letter purporting to have been
addressed by Washington to William Fauntleroy, Sr., Esq.,
in Richmond, enclosing one to Miss Betsy, who, it is made to
appear, had also refused Washington's addresses. Letters and
traditions of this character should be received with caution, for
while vague reports and surmises of an affair of the heart may
be dilated upon in a bantering way among friends of the parties
where there is little or no foundation for the allegation, yet
they should be subjected to scrutiny and some positive evidence
adduced before they are accepted as historical facts.</p></div>

Virginians, dated as early as 1746 or 1747, to secure a share in
the lucrative Indian trade, and with the prospect of opening to
settlement the lands on the upper waters of the Ohio. An
early move in this direction had been made by Colonel Thomas
Cresap, a man of courage, judgment and enterprise&mdash;qualities
required for trading successfully with the Indians. He had
erected his cabin at Oldtown, Md. About 1746 Lawrence and
Augustine Washington, after making some cautious business
ventures in the Indian trade, with others assisted to organize
"this Ohio Company." Thomas Lee, whose second son, Richard
Henry Lee, was to become so conspicuous a patriot of the Revolution,
and John Hanbury, a wealthy London merchant, were
original members of this company, into which still other men
of substance and standing were admitted, and to which, in
1749, the British government gave a charter, as "The Ohio
Company," with a grant of half a million acres of land, to be
located between the Monongahela and Kanawha rivers, on the
south side of the Ohio. With but twenty shares of stock at
first issue, the company's prosperity seemed assured, and both
Governor Dinwiddie and George Mason, at a later date purchased
an interest in it. Among the early Washington manuscripts
appears the above memorandum of a survey for this
company. Although this entry is without date it must have
been earlier, judging from its position in the note-book, than
the charter. This document imposed, as conditions of the land
grant, that the company should at once survey two hundred
thousand acres, and within seven years secure the settlement
of not less than one hundred families, erect forts, and maintain
a garrison against the Indians,&mdash;conditions on the fulfilment
of which they were to be for ten years exempt from the payment
of quit-rents. Mr. Christopher Gist was employed as the
company's agent, and on October 19, 1749, entered upon his
duties of inspecting the country, contiguous to the Ohio river,
reporting upon the character of the lands, making surveys,
keeping a journal of his observations, drawing plans of the territory,
etc. In 1750 the company built a small store-house at
Will's creek and stocked it with goods from London to the
value of £4,000. In 1752 Mr. Gist held a council with the
Indians on the Ohio in behalf of the company, and secured
their permission to lay out a town and erect a fort at McKee's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Rocks at the mouth of Chartier's creek, upon the east side of
the Ohio, a few miles below Pittsburg. Washington, in his
diary, alludes to this, and says of the position: "I think it
greatly inferior, either for defense or advantage, especially the
latter: For a fort at the forks would be equally well situated
on the Ohio, and have the entire command of the Monongahela."
In 1751 the company began making a road to the
mouth of the Monongahela, but for lack of adequate resources,
made only slow progress. The company looked upon the lands
around Will's creek as being within their grant. They also
erected a store-house at the mouth of Redstone on the Monongahela
and began some improvements at the forks of the Ohio,
immediately after completing those at Will's creek. At the
latter place they had the adjacent lands surveyed on both sides
the stream, above and below the forks, and laid out a town to
which they gave the name of Charlottesburg in honor of the
Princess Charlotte, afterward wife of King George. The
French and Indian war, with other stirring political events,
compelled the company to be cautious and to contract its operations,
but, its embarrassments increasing from the course pursued
toward it by the English government, prompted by envious
rival interests, the consent of its agent, George Mercer,
Esq., was finally gained to merge the Ohio Company into a
Grand Company, under what was known as the Walpole Grant
or Company. Their proposal was as follows: "We, the Committee
of the Purchasers of a Tract of Country for a new Province
on the Ohio in America, do hereby admit the Ohio Company
as a Co-Purchaser with us for two shares of the said
Purchase,<sup><span class="bold medium">*</span></sup> in Consideration of the Engagement of their Agent,
Col. Mercer, to withdraw the application of the said Company
for a separate Grant within the Limits of the said Purchase.

Washington, of Westmoreland, the wife of George's half-brother,
Augustine, with whom he had made his home while
attending Mr. William's Academy. Austin is, or has been, in
Virginia a contraction for Augustine. Augustine Moore, a
notable character, is recorded interchangeably, in land and other
records, as Augustine and as Austin Moore. It is presumed
that "The Maryland Housewife" was intended to have been
written, that being the name of a popular book on cookery and
the art of housekeeping at that period. The date of this memorandum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
is presumed to be 1748. A charge in his book of
accounts kept at this time, and which was among the relics
of Lawrence Washington sold in Philadelphia in the spring of
1891, would fix the date as July 28th, 1748. It was not an unusual
thing for Washington in his youth to use contractions in
writing the first names of his brothers, the following are examples:
Aus., Austin for Augustine; Sam for Samuel; Jack and
John, simply for John Augustine.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_62_62" id="Footnote_62_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62_62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> Honorable William Fairfax, of "Belvoir," Fairfax county,
Va., was born 1691 in Yorkshire, England, where his father
that year became high sheriff of the county. His father was
the son of Henry Fairfax, 2d son of 4th Lord Fairfax and Anna
(Harrison) Fairfax, whose sister, Eleanora Harrison, of South
Cave, married in 1689, Henry Washington; their son, Richard
Washington, who resided in London, was, therefore, an English
cousin of Wm. Fairfax, and a correspondent both of his and of
Col. George Washington's (see Washington's correspondence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in <cite>Sparks</cite>). Wm. Fairfax lost his father when quite young
and was educated at his uncle's, Sir John Lowther's College.
Through the influence of Capt. Fairfax, of the Royal Navy, he
entered that service in 1710 and served for two years. He
then joined the British army in Spain under Col. Martin Bladen,
who had married a Fairfax, and was stationed at St. Helena in
1716-17, and subsequently at the Bahamas, and returned to
England in October, 1717. Having married in the Bahamas,
Sarah, daughter of Maj. Walker, of Nassau, she accompanied
him to England. In 1718 Wm. Fairfax was sent out with
Captain or Governor Woodes Rogers as chief justice to suppress
the pirates infesting the West Indies. His residence was
at Nassau, New Providence. The business for which he accepted
office having been completed and the climate not being
congenial, he in 1725 removed to New England. Here he received
an appointment to the custom house at Salem, which he
held until 1734. While a resident of Salem, his first wife died
and was buried there. His son George William was born in
Nassau, three of his children were born in Salem. Thomas, of
the Royal Navy, was killed in battle; Anne married Lawrence
Washington, and was the first mistress of Mount Vernon; and
Sarah married John Carlyle, of Alexandria, Va., who was a
major and commissary in the French and Indian war. Mr.
Fairfax married, January 18, 1731, Deborah Clarke, of Salem,
Mass. Her first child was Bryan, 8th Lord Fairfax, born at
Salem 1732, but better known as the Rev. Bryan Fairfax, who
died in 1802. In 1734 Wm. Fairfax accepted an offer, he had
before declined, to remove to Virginia and act as agent for his
cousin, Lord Thomas Fairfax, in the management of the vast
Fairfax land estate. He at first took up his residence in Westmoreland
county and remained there for several years, but afterward
improved the plantation, built "Belvoir" mansion, six
miles below "Mount Vernon," and removed to it. He was
residing there in 1739, when Lord Fairfax first visited Virginia
and made it his home for a year. Wm. Fairfax, from his high
character and acquaintance with business, soon came to the
front among the leading men in Virginia. Besides being agent
for his cousin, he served in the assembly of Virginia, and after
the death of John Blair was president of the Provincial council
and collector of his majesty's customs for the South Potomac.
His second wife bore him two children, besides Bryan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
already mentioned, William Henry, killed at the storming of
Quebec in 1759; and Hannah, who married Warner Washington,
cousin to George Washington. William Fairfax was a
man of great executive ability and much beloved by the community.
He died September 3, 1757. His wife survived him
but a few years. "Belvoir" was left to George W. Fairfax
and was his residence until he went to England in 1773.</p></div>

toilet outfit. Washington had a strong beard and was
early called upon to use his razor. Long, full beards were not
then in fashion in America. It is a notable fact that there is
not a portrait extant of an American-born patriot or statesman
of the Revolutionary period, painted with a full beard. This
memorandum, although not dated, is believed to have been
written in 1748. The clean shaven face was constrained by
the fashion of the continent; and prevailed as the custom in
England and France for a period of quite 75 years.</p></div>

bed rooms were not heated, hence the custom of warming
beds before retiring in winter, and the necessity for wearing
night caps is more apparent, and, further, the head was frequently
shaven and wigs were worn during the day by many.
It is the tradition that Patrick Henry wore at home, in the day,
even, when not in full dress, a "tarred cotton cap," whilst in
public he wore a wig. In speaking, when he was earnestly
moved, a striking emphasis of his is said to have been a rapid
whirling of his wig around his head.</p></div>

<p>I went Last Tuesday not knowing your Lordship
had that very Day set out for Neavils to see whether
you had any further Commands or directions to give
concerning the Surveying of Cacapehon and as your
Lordship was not at Home I was inform by Col<sup>o</sup> G.
Fairfax that you had not any Directions in Particular
more than were given to the other Surveyors as
your Lordship had mentioned I therefore have made
bold to Proceed on General Directions from him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Missing this Opportunity of Good Weather may be of
considerable Hindrance I shall Wait on your Lordship
at Frederick Court in November to obey your further

"My Journey Over the Mountains." It is proper to
state that the journal was kept in a small, vellum-bound, blank
book, 6 by 3¾ inches in size, closely written on both sides of
the leaf. Either from a desire to classify his memoranda, or
for want of a second book, or from some motive of economy,
he turned the book around and began from the other end to
keep a record more particularly relating to his surveys and
miscellaneous affairs. His field notes of surveys were kept in
a book of the same size as the one described, from which the
most of the following surveys are taken. The other surveys
are found on loose sheets which have been bound and denominated
miscellaneous papers; a few of them having dates, enables
the editor to place them in chronological order.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_76_76" id="Footnote_76_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76_76"><span class="label">[76]</span></a> Culpeper county, Virginia, was formed by act of assembly
in 1748, and named in honor of Lord Thomas Culpeper, governor
of Virginia from 1682 to 1686. The old family name
was spelled with two p's, but in using the name as a locality
one p is dropped. Its original form, however, was Colepeper.
The widow of Lord Culpeper spelled her name and
wrote it, "Mar. Culpeper&mdash;Leeds Castle, Dec. 19, 1706."
Lord Culpeper and Lord Arlington had obtained from Charles
II in 1672 a grant of proprietary rights over the whole of
Virginia, but within a short time, in consequence of resistance
by the colonists, surrendered all except quit rents and
escheats, and a duty of three half-pence per pound on tobacco.
Two years after ceasing to be governor, Lord Culpeper,
who had become by purchase sole owner of the grant,
further abandoned all his rights except that of property
in the lands of that part of the Northern Neck beyond the
Blue Ridge, with an annual pension of £600 for twenty years
in lieu of what he gave up. This estate of about 5,700,000
acres of land in the Shenandoah valley and the mountains beyond,
went to his daughter and heiress, Catherine, who became
the wife of Thomas, the 5th Lord Fairfax, and from her to
their son Thomas the 6th, and the first American Lord Fairfax
of Washington's time. Lord Culpeper had been one of the
commissioners of plantations under Charles II, and was a man of
ability for business and public affairs, although rapacious; and,
as governor, wholly British, without that sympathy for Virginia
interest, such as Berkeley, with all his faults, had shown. The
county of Culpeper, however, was conspicuous for the patriotism
of its inhabitants during the Revolution. Her "minute
men," Randolph said on the floor of the United States Senate,
"were raised in a minute, armed in a minute, marched in a
minute, fought in a minute, and vanquished in a minute."
The motto on their flag was, "The Culpeper Minute Men,"
along the top border; in the center a curled rattlesnake with
head erect and rattling tail; on either side the words "Liberty&mdash;or
Death;" and beneath, along the lower border, "Don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Tread on Me." In the clerk's office of Culpeper court house
is recorded the following: "20 July, 1749 [O. S.] George
Washington, Gent., produced a commission from the President
and Master of William and Mary College, appointing him to
be surveyor of this county, which was read, and thereupon he
took the usual oaths," etc.</p></div>

check mark signature of George Washington as a licensed surveyor
of Culpeper county. The plat of this survey is published
by Sparks, vol. 1, p. 14, and is reproduced here, as the editor
has failed, so far, in finding the original among any of the
Washington papers extant. The plat bears date two days after
he filed his certificate and took the necessary oath before the
court in Culpeper county referred to in the preceding note.</p></div>

in 1738, out of Orange county which, prior to that date, had
embraced all of Virginia beyond the Blue Ridge. The bounds
of Frederick were defined as follows: the Potomac on the north,
the Blue Ridge on the east, and on the south and west a line
drawn from the head spring of the Hedgman creek to the head
spring of the Potomac; all beyond this line, comprising the
immense western territory belonging to Virginia, constituted
Augusta county. The earliest Frederick county court was held
at Winchester, Nov. 11, 1743; and that of Augusta county was
held at Beverley's Mill Place, now Staunton, Dec. 9, 1745.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
